However, I recently made the decision to switch to a static site generator. Let me explain why.\n\nWordPress is widely known as a great tool for blogging, but it also poses a significant security risk. Hackers often target WordPress servers, which prompted me to explore alternative options for hosting my blog. After careful consideration, I decided to use a public blogging platform called Zhihu. On Zhihu, I wrote several columns about the Rust language and the Fuchsia operating system.\nUnfortunately, Zhihu is primarily a Chinese platform, limiting my audience reach to Chinese readers only. Additionally, due to the platform's focus on profitability, it has become inundated with rumors, cheap jokes, and fabricated stories. Consequently, it is not an ideal environment for engaging in serious technical discussions.\nHence, I have chosen to utilize a static site generator and host my blog on GitHub Pages. This decision allows me greater control over my content and ensures a more focused and reliable platform for sharing my ideas.\nFor those interested in the technology choices behind my blog site, here is a list:\n\nZola: A static site generator written in Rust. I chose it because it is written in Rust, and it is fast.\nEven: The theme used for this site.\nGitHub Actions: for CI/CD\nGitHub Pages: for hosting the site\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/hello-world/","title":"Hello, world"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/time-to-write-os-tutorials-in-uefi/":{"body":"There are quite a lot of OS tutorials and YouTube videos out there. However, most of them are written to boot in BIOS mode.\nWell, it is 2023 now, 19 years since Intel open sourced UEFI. Meanwhile, Intel is trying to replace x86_64 with x86_64s, which is a pure 64bit platform. And, of course, it will only support UEFI (UEFI CSM will be removed).\nUEFI is a more secure and more powerful booting system. Almost all modern operating system are booted via UEFI. There seems to be no reason to continue writing OS tutorials for BIOS. Taking care about switching to long mode, or enabling paging is no longer necessary, but annoying.\nAfter searching Google, I see there are very limited information about writing OS in UEFI. The information are scattered in different places, and it is hard to find a complete tutorial. Therefore, I decided to write a series of tutorials about writing OS in UEFI.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/time-to-write-os-tutorials-in-uefi/","title":"Time to Write OS Tutorials in UEFI"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":128,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/hello-world/":{"body":135,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/time-to-write-os-tutorials-in-uefi/":{"body":90,"title":5}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
