# Why the name

There are multiple reasons for this name.

I am a big fan of [Apple](https://www.apple.com). I love their products, and I love their design. I also love their slogan: "Think different". I want to write something different from others, and I want to think different from others.

Secondly, I have a wide range of interests, including robotics, operating systems, programming languages, and high performance web services, and a lot more. I'm not able to delve deep into every field, I enjoy exploring various topics and gaining insights from each of them.

By combining my passion for innovation, and my interest in various tech fields, "Have a bite" captures the essence of my blog.
