Welcome to my personal blog site! I'm [Tony Huang](https://twitter.com/greatony), a passionate software engineer, dedicated maker, and the CTO of a dynamic startup company.

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and lessons learned along the way. From technical tutorials and project updates to thought-provoking discussions on the future of technology, you'll find a diverse range of content that reflects my passion for all things software and innovation.

### Why do I setup this site?

If you want to know more about why this site exists, please read [Hello, world](../hello-world.md).

### Why the name?

There are multiple reasons for this name.

I am a big fan of [Apple](https://www.apple.com). I love their products, and I love their design. I also love their slogan: "Think different". I want to write something different from others, and I want to think different from others.

Secondly, I have a wide range of interests, including robotics, operating systems, programming languages, and high performance web services, and a lot more. I'm not able to delve deep into every field, I enjoy exploring various topics and gaining insights from each of them.

By combining my passion for innovation, and my interest in various tech fields, "Have a bite" captures the essence of my blog.
